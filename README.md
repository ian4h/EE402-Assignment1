=================

Ian Harrison DCU 
EE402 Object-oriented Programming with Embedded Systems 2014/15
Your first assignment is to write a section of code that demonstrates the following aspects of OOP in C++:
1.  Over-loading using multiple constructors.
2.  Over-riding of a method through inheritance.
3.  An example of Multiple Inheritance (does not have to make perfect sense).
4.  Separate compilation (with all classes).
5.  Example use of a friend functions that receives an object of a class.
6.  Abstract classes with a method that is required in all derived classes.
7.  A class with a modified copy constructor and demonstrate the effect of this on pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
8.  A working destructor with some basic functionality. Demonstrate it working.
9. Correct use of over-loaded operators (+, = and ==) for one of your classes.
10.  Correct use of all access specifiers (public, private, protected) in an appropriate way.
11. Operations on pointers to arrays of objects. The operation should call the function that is defined in point 6 above.
12. Use of all four C++ style casts. 
13. Use of dynamic binding with virtual & non-virtual methods. Demonstrate the effect.
14. Correct use of new and deete for the allocation of an object/objects, with operations on the object using pointers. (Can be combined with other points)
15. Static states of a class and an example usage. Demonstrate the effect.
16. Demonstrates the difference between a C++ class and struct.
17. Passing an object to a method by const reference. Demonstrate the effect.
18. Write a straightforward class template.
19. Use of the vector container to contain a number of objects of one of your classes.
20. Use of an algorithm on your container.
